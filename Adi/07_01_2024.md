****Prompt:**** write me a typescript for using an unspecified ai model api to ask questions and receive responses; leave comments in places where additional code dependent on the type of ai model needs to be added<br/>
*All models responded with slightly differing but overall functional solutions. Something interesting to note is that all of them used the example question "What is the capital of France?" within their code, except Copilot which used "What is the meaning of life?"*
