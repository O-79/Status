For the two careers that I researched when imaginingn I was a 9th grader, I chose Biomedical Engineering and Environmental Science rather than Computer Science. Biomedical Engineering blends 
biology, medicine, and engineering to create technologies that enhance healthcare. It requires strong background in science and math, typically obtained through a bachelor's degree, with
advanced roles needing futher education. Biomedical engineers work in various settings like labs, hospitals, and offices, focusing on designing medical devices, conducting research, 
and collaborating with healthcare professionals. 

The salary for biomedical engineering is roughly around $95,000 to $120,000 annually, as of 2024. Entry-level positions typically start at $70,000 - $75,000 per year. I asked chatgpt about 
the best places to work in this field, since many people consider the location and would have to bring their family along if they decide to relocate because of a job offer in a different 
location. 

Environmental Science is a field focused on studying and addressing environemtnal issues to protect and improve the natural world. It requires strong background in biology, chemistry, physics, 
as well as earth science, typically obtained through a bachelor's degree, with advanced roles often requiring a master's or Phd degrees. The advanced starting salary for environmental 
scientists is $50,000 to $60,000 per year, with potential for higher earnings as they gain expereince and specialize in areas like conservation, pollution control, etc. 

These are the questions I asked chatgpt and it answered them pretty straightforward and not too complicated after I asked it to answer in simple terms. Without asking it to answer 
it in simple terms, it would answer in longer paragraphs that make almost no sense. For the
