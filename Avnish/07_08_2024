What Did I Do? 
1. Created a Command Line Interface outline to get started with the project. 
2. Tested all of the bugs that I have in the code. Code has around 150 lines. 
3. Gave the user options to select from different careers, and then provided the salary benefits they would receive. Will update what bachelor's degree they need, etc. 
4. Also gave the option for the user to select from a location, and then based on the location the user will be bale to chose from different universities, etc.
