Updated the functions to be more conversational, added some questions in the code like what are the user's interests, aptitude, degree level, etc. 
Also added some graphics to the code such as colors and tree like structure in the menu when the user chooses from the different locations and universities. 
Got to 250 lines of code, was deciding whether or not to separate the files rather than only having one file. 
organized the code by adding some comments.
