The university list was not displaying, so I had to make a new method where there would be a try catch to see when I enter in the state abbreviation with the city, the names 
of the universities would display. If I enter in Raleigh, NC then it would display the correct universities. 
If I only enter in Raleigh, without the state, then it wouldn't display them.
